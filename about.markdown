Use this space to greet your visitors and give them a quick sense of who you are.
One or two sentences is perfect.

## What I'm Working On

- Project or role you're focused on right now
- Another initiative or passion project worth highlighting
- Anything upcoming that excites you

## Backstory

Share a short origin story—how you got here, key milestones, or pivotal
experiences that shaped you.

## Outside of Work
I like to stay active through lifting weights and being outside trying all types of different sports. I also enjoy video games. My current favorites are BF6, Rocket League and Counter Strike.
